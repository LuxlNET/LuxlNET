## About Me

My name is Felix and I come from beautiful Bavaria. I have been fascinated by the world of IT since I was a child.


As an IT specialist for system integration, I am lucky enough to be able to live out my passion for IT in my job. My knowledge and experience cover various areas of this exciting industry.


I do smaller projects from time to time.


Feel free to browse around and contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
